CaesarSolver is a program to crack Caesar Cipher encrypted ASCII text

Normal Caesar solvers only consider the case of 26 keys, which represents
only single-case alphabetic characters. But what if your text is in full
ASCII? This will solve it for you.

The program will output all 256 possible strings from the given input. Unless
you specify a key, in which case it will only output for that key.

Usage: CaesarSolver -i inputfile [-o outputFile] [-k key]
	Read hex digits represented in ASCII from the provided file in -i
	Decrypt it using all possible 255 keys. when -k is given, only test key
	Output to given file, or stdout if none is given
